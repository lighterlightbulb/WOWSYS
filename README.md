# WOWSYS

The system that makes you go "WOW!"

## Introduction

As of right now, the only "WOW" factor within the operating system is just how empty, or barebones it is. This is a constant work-in-progress, so change is to be expected constantly.

The goals for this operating system is to produce a functioning:
- Kernel
- Bootloader
- Operating System
  - Easy Driver Support (targeting Windows drivers)
- Custom C-Like syntax programming language

Clearly, these are very ambitious goals that will not be reached without taking the time to think over each feature, implementing them, and thorough testing of each. Maybe one of these features might get removed due to how high of a goal it is. Who knows? Only time will tell.

## License

We dedicate WOWSYS as free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.

## Documentation

We aim to fully document WOWSYS using the documentation tool named Doxygen. Clone this repository, and run `doxygen Doxyfile` to output a full documentation in both HTML and LaTex form.

## Build

Right now, WOWSYS has only been tested to build, and is only supported to build on a Windows 10 64-bit machine with Windows Subsystem for Linux installed. Linux build support will hopefully be added soon.
